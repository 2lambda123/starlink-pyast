<h2>Examples</h2>
This section contains some examples of PyAST code. Some of these
operation can be simplified by using the <a href="node5.html">higher-level
functions</a> in the <code>starlink.Atl</code> module, which provide wrappers
for some of the code fragments shown below.
<p>
In general, these examples show the Python equivalent of the
corresponding example in the "How To..." section of the documentation for
the native C version of AST,
<a href="http://www.starlink.ac.uk/cgi-bin/htxserver/sun211.htx/sun211.html?xref_">
SUN/211</a>, which should be consulted for further information on each
example.




<h4>...Read a WCS Calibration from a Dataset</h4>
<pre class=pycode>
import pyfits
import starlink.Grf as Grf

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#  Open the FITS file using (for instance) pyfits. A list of the HDUs
#  in the FITS file is returned.
hdu_list = pyfits.open( 'test.fit' )

#  Create a FitsChan and fill it with the FITS header cards in the
#  primary HDU (element zero of the list returned by pyfits.open).
fitschan = Ast.FitsChan( Atl.PyFITSAdapter(hdu_list[ 0 ]) )

#  Note which encoding has been used for the WCS information. This is only
#  necessary if you later wish to write modified headers out using the
#  same encoding. See section "...Write a Modified WCS Calibration to a
#  Dataset" below.
encoding = fitschan.Encoding

#  Read WCS information from the FitsChan. Additionally, this removes all
#  WCS information from the FitsChan.
wcsinfo = fitschan.read()

</pre>




<h4>...Validate WCS Information</h4>
<pre class=pycode>

#  Check that the FITS header contained WCS in a form that can be
#  understood by AST.
if wcsinfo == None:
   print( "Failed to read WCS information from test.fit" )

#  Check that the object read from the FitsChan is of the expected class
#  (Ast.FrameSet).
elif not isinstance( wcsinfo, Ast.FrameSet ):
   print( "A "+wcsinfo.__class__.__name__+" was read from test.fit - "
          "was expecting an Ast.FrameSet" )

#  This particular code example can only handle WCS with 2 pixel axes
#  (given by Nin) and 2 WCS axes (given by Nout).
elif wcsinfo.Nin != 2 or wcsinfo.Nout != 2:
   print( "The world coordinate system is not 2-dimensional" )

#  Proceed if the WCS information was read OK.
else:
   ...

</pre>




<h4>...Display AST Data</h4>
<pre class=pycode>
#  Display the internal representation of the AST FrameSet
   print( wcsinfo )

#  or alternatively...
   wcsinfo.show()
</pre>

<h4>...Convert Between Pixel and World Coordinates</h4>
<pre class=pycode>

#  Store the x and y pixel coordinates at 3 points in the FITS image
   xpixel = [ 120., 150., 180. ]
   ypixel = [ 175., 150., 125. ]

#  Convert back to pixel coordinates.

</pre>




<h4>...Test if a WCS is a Celestial Coordinate System</h4>
<pre class=pycode>

#  Obtain a pointer to the current Frame and determine if it is a SkyFrame.
#  The frame index argument could have been omitted in this case since it
#  defaults to Ast.CURRENT.
   frame = wcsinfo.getframe( Ast.CURRENT )

</pre>



<h4>...Ensure that WCS Axes are in a Specified Order</h4>
<pre class=pycode>

#  The axes within a WCS FrameSet obtained from an external source may be
#  in any arbitrary order. This order may be determined by examining the
#  attributes (Domain, Label, IsLonAxis, IsLatAxis, etc) of the current
#  Frame in the FrameSet. If your application code for some reason requires
#  the axes to be in a specific order, this may be arranged using the
#  findframe() method. You need to provide it with a Frame to act as a
#  template that  defines the nature and order of the axes required by
#  your application code. For instance, if your code is restricted to
#  2-dimensional WCS FrameSets that represent (RA,Dec) axes, in that
#  order, then you create a suitable SkyFrame with these properties to
#  act as a template, and call findframe on the original WCS FrameSet to
#  create a modified WCS FrameSet with the same properties as the
#  template (if possible). For the above example, a default SkyFrame is
#  an appropriate template since the default SkyFrame represents ICRS
#  (RA,Dec) axes. So if "wcsinfo" is the original WCS FrameSet we can
#  do...
   newwcs = wcsinfo.findframe( Ast.SkyFrame() )

#  It may be that the "wcsinfo" FrameSet did not contain any celestial
#  axes, or was not 2-dimensional. in which case the above invocation of
#  findframe will have failed. Check for this.
   if newwcs:

#  Demonstrate that the above has succeeded by printing the labels of the
#  two axes in the current Frame.
      print( "Axis 1: {0}".format( newwcs.Label_1 ) )
      print( "Axis 3: {0}".format( newwcs.Label_2 ) )

</pre>




<h4>...Format Coordinates for Display</h4>
<pre class=pycode>

# Loop round all the positions to be formatted
   for (x,y) in zip( xworld, yworld):

#  Get the formatted value for the first WCS axis, and append the units
#  string. Then do the same for the second WCS axis.
      xtext = wcsinfo.format( 1, x ) + " " + wcsinfo.Unit_1
      ytext = wcsinfo.format( 2, y ) + " " + wcsinfo.Unit_2

#  Print both values.
      print( "Position = "+xtext+", "+ytext )

</pre>




<h4>...Display Coordinates as they are Transformed</h4>
<pre class=pycode>

#  Tell the Mapping to report each position as it is transformed.

#  Join the two Mappings together, so that they are applied one after

#  that FitsChan uses to write FITS header cards to a PyFITS HDU. Note,
#  doing it this way will mean the FITS file does not inherit the non-WCS
#  keywords from the input FITS file. If this is a problem, then the
#  FitsChan that was used for reading the WCS should also be used for
#  writing the WCS. This will retain non-WCS keywords in the output FITS
#  file.

#  convert the FrameSet to a set of FITS header cards stored in the FitsChan).
   if fitschan2.write( wcsinfo2 ) == 0 :

#  represented using the original WCS encoding), then use the native AST
#  encoding instead.
      fitschan2.Encoding = "NATIVE"
      fitschan2.write( wcsinfo2 )

#  The cards are currently stored in the FitsChan. They will be written
#  to the PyFITS HDU when the FitsChan is deleted. But in Python, object
#  deletion can happen at unexpected times, so to be in complete control,
#  we ensure the cards are written out now by invoking the writefits method
#  now.
